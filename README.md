This repository contains the complete analysis pipeline for bulk RNA-seq data profiling β-galactosidase (B-Gal) positive and negative populations from CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. The project includes:

Preprocessing of raw FASTQ files

Read alignment and quantification

Differential expression analysis using DESeq2

Visualization of top differentially expressed genes

Heatmaps of selected gene sets and shared signatures

Scripts and metadata for reproducibility

This analysis supports the investigation of senescence and transcriptional regulation in human T cells and integrates results across multiple cell types and conditions.
